# coin-toss
This is fun simple Python script for simulating coin toss.

To use the script run the following commands:

python ./coin_toss_sumulation.py --bias <Enter any integer between 0 and 100 inclusive> --count <Number of times you want the simulation to run>

eg. python ./coin_toss_sumulation.py --bias 40 --count 1000

If we run the command without arguments then bias is set to default value of 50 and count is set to default value of 100

eg. python ./coin_toss_sumulation.py
